Best Crystals (75 Crystals Asset Pack)

This pack contains 75 assets, 15 unique meshes with PBR textures in five different color schemes. 

First Steps:
All Assets can be found in the models folder with materials already assigned to them. If you want a different color scheme for one of the crystals, just assign one of the differently colored materials to it.
All assets are packed onto a single texture sheet for runtime efficiency. So you can use a single material for all the crystals.
As for any project, Linear Rendering is recommended to get the best visuals. The textures are PBR calibrated so they look best on Desktop PC or other hardware that can afford PBR rendering.


Additional Maps:
To further modify the look or use custom shaders, additional Maps can be found inside the textures folder. Among those are a color mask, transluceny and specular level textures.
